# tDCDiscover

## Description
This is the experiment code for the tDCDiscover, an algorithm for mining tDC from time series data. In addition, the project also includes DC mining algorithms FastDC, DC_Finder, FDCD, and approximate DC mining algorithm ADCEnum.

## Datasets
 - **IDF**: Sensordataofaninduced draft fan.

 - **CO**: Gas sensor recordings data.

 - **Climate**: Weather sensor data from Delhi, India.

 - **Stock**: Historical stock data.

 - **Telemetry**: Environmental sensor telemetry data.

 - **Weather**: Operational sensor data from solar power plants.

 - **Occupancy**: Room monitoring sensor data.

 - **Pump**: Water pump sensor data.

All data are real-world data. The IDF and Pump sizes exceed the 100M limit of GitHub, so only part of them are uploaded.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher version

## Running
run
```shell
python ./main.py
```
